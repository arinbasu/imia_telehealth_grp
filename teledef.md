## Abstract
In this paper we describe the results of a survey we conducted on the definitions of telehealth among 100 plus members of the telehealth working group of the International Medical Informatics Association. An informal survey was distributed among the members and 19 members participated in the survey returning their responses. The responses show that by and large there was consensus that telehealth is a bridging mechanism between the patient and the provider but there is less consensus as to whether mobile applications, store and forward mechanisms or mobile messaging systems are also part of telehealth or not. The results of this informal survey suggests the need for wider and more detailed study to understand how professionals view telehealth and how they define their field
